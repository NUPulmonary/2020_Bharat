_Abstract_:
Lung transplantation can potentially be a life-saving treatment for patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. Concerns limiting transplant include recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the allograft, technical challenges imposed by viral-mediated injury to the native lung, and potential risk for allograft infection by pathogens associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia in the native lung. Most importantly, the native lung might recover, resulting in long-term outcomes preferable to transplant. Here, we report results of the first successful lung transplantation procedures in patients with non-resolving COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the United States. We performed sm-FISH to detect both positive and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the explanted lung tissue, extracellular matrix imaging using SHIELD tissue clearance, and single cell RNA-Seq on explant and warm post-mortem lung biopsies from patients who died from severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Lungs from patients with prolonged COVID-19 were free of virus but pathology showed extensive evidence of injury and fibrosis which resembled end-stage pulmonary fibrosis. We used a machine learning approach to project single cell RNA-Seq data from patients with late stage COVID-19 onto a single cell atlas of pulmonary fibrosis, revealing similarities across cell lineages. There was no recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 or pathogens associated with pre-transplant ventilator associated pneumonias following transplantation. Our findings suggest that some patients with severe COVID-19 develop fibrotic lung disease for which lung transplantation is the only option for survival.
